    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Internet has been growing dramatically in terms of size and capacity, and accessibility in the last years. Communication requirements of distributed services and applications running on top of the Internet have become increasingly demanding. Examples are real-time interactive video or financial trading.  Providing such services involves stringent requirements in terms of acceptable latency, loss, or jitter.  Those requirements lead to the articulation of Service Level Objectives (SLOs) which are to be met.  Those SLOs become part of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that articulate a contract between the provider and the consumer of a service.  To fulfill a service, it needs to be ensured that the SLOs are met.  Examples of service fulfillment clauses can be found on <xref target="RFC7297" />). Violations of SLOs can be associated with significant financial loss, which can by divided in two types. First, there is the loss incurred by the service users (e.g., the trader whose orders are not executed in a timely manner) and the loss incurred by the service provider in terms of penalties for not meeting the service and loss of revenues due to reduced customer satisfaction. Thus, the service level requirements of critical network services have become a key concern for network administrators. To ensure that SLAs are not being violated, service levels need to be constantly monitored at the network infrastructure layer. To that end, network measurements must take place.</t>

    <section title="Benefits of an Autonomic Solution">
        <t>The use case considered here is the distributed autonomic detection of SLA violations. 
The use of Autonomic Networking (AN) properties can help such detection through an efficient activation of measurement sessions <xref target="P2PBNM-Nobre-2012" />. The problem to be solved by AN in the present use case is how to steer the process of measurement session activation by a complete solution that sets all necessary parameters for this activation to operate efficiently, reliably and securely, with no required human intervention, while allowing for their input.</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
